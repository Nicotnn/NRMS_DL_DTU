Ekstra Bladet Recommender System, created for the RecSys'24 Challenge.

# Summary

- This repository contains an implementation of the paper "Neural News Recommendation with Multi-Head Self-Attention" from Wu et. al. using Pytorch. 
- This project was the final submission for the DTU Deep Learning course 
- The data was obtained from the [Ekstra Bladet EB-NeRD Recsys 2024 Challenge](https://recsys.eb.dk)


# Credits

- By Nico Tananow and Kevin Moore for DTU course 02456 Deep Learning.
- Credits to Johannes Kruse for the initial repository that we sought inspiration and helper functions from: https://github.com/ebanalyse/ebnerd-benchmark
- Everything in `src` directory is from Johannes Kruse's repository and everything in `our_implementation` is made by us.

# How to Run

- Place `data` directory from Ekstra Bladet (https://recsys.eb.dk) in `our_implementation/`
- Run `main.ipynb`
